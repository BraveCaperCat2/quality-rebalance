# Quality rebalance

After playing Space Age for 400 hours, I love quality!
It's my favorite feature in the expansion.
However... it also feels underbaked in a few areas.
This vanilla-style mod is designed to fix the remaining issues in the quality system.
All features can be toggled.

# Quality promethium science

In Space Age, promethium asteroid chunks are a "self-recycle" meaning that you would need around 65536 asteroid chunks to create 1 legendary asteroid chunk.
Even uncommon science would be 16x more expensive than normal quailty science.
This means that quality promethium science is never worth making.

This mod adds a new promethium reprocessing recipe designed to interact well with the quality system.

# Quality holmium

The holmium plate recipe is crafted via a holmium fluid.
This means it's impossible to convert quality holmium ore into quality holmium plates.

This mod adds a new way to make quality holmium by using some aquilo mechanics.
